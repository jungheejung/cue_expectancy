# expect-actual ~ cue * trial {#ch06_Jepma}


## Overview
The purpose of this markdown is to benchmark the plots from Jepma et al. (2018). 
Here, we plot the expectancy ratings and the actual ratings, with the high and low cues -- in one panel. 

### Some thoughts, TODOs {.unlisted .unnumbered}
* plot 2. some runs were repeated or omitted for the subjects that have more than 72 trials. I need to identify that list and work on the behavioral data. 
* I need to check whether the counterbalancing was done correctly.
