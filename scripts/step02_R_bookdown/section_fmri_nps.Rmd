# (PART\*) fMRI NPS {.unnumbered}

# fMRI NPS and other signatures {#fmri_time .unnumbered}

Here, I focus on modeling NPS as a function of several variables. 
NPS differs as a function of cue, stim, session and expectations, but the cluster means, demeaning process and contrast coding of the session effects are quite important


* Chapter \@ref(NPS_singletrialqc) plots the time series of pain stimulus onset, using TTL2 as reference

* Chapter \@ref(NPS_EndersTofighi) uses the demean/cluster mean values and examines multiple factors that predict NPS. Expectation clustermeans are good at predicting NPS values in a cue, stim, session int
