# About

This is an analysis book written in Markdown. The purpose is to keep track of analyses and summarize findings, while decluttering from result vs. code. 

## Usage 

Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file. This .Rmd is migrated from the git repository cue-expectancy and specifically from the folder **step02_R**. Each .Rmd file was developed as a standalone analysis pipeline. Once validated, the identical .Rmd is migrated to the bookdown folder and edited for bookdown compiling.
