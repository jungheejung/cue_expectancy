# About

This is an analysis book written in Markdown. The purpose is to keep track of analyses and summarize findings, while decluttering from result vs. code.

## Usage

Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file. This .Rmd is migrated from the git repository cue-expectancy [cue-expectancy](https://github.com/jungheejung/cue_expectancy) and specifically from the folder [**step02_R**](https://github.com/jungheejung/cue_expectancy/tree/main/scripts/step02_R/utils). Each .Rmd file was developed as a standalone analysis pipeline. Once validated, the identical .Rmd is migrated to the bookdown folder and edited for bookdown compiling.

## Order

- Behavioral analysis
- Reinforcement learning simulations
- fMRI analysis (signatures)
- fMRI FIR time series analysis
