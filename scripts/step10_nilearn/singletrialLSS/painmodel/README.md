Here, we have different versions of modeling stimulus epoch. 
One could
* model the full period `subjectpipeline.py`
* model just the Pain plateau, using TTL2 and TTL3 `subjectpipline_TTL.py`
* model the motor responses as a base comparison model `subjectpipeline_motor.py`
* model the plateau period as the primary, but also model the rampup and rampdown dpoch as tertiary regression `subjectpipeline_rampupdown.py`
