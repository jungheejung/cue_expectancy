In these chapters, I extract the BOLD signal for the stimulus epoch, for each ROI over the course of 42 TRs. This is to cover 20s after the onset of stimulus delivery. TTL2 and TTL1 signals in the onset.

- TTL1 refers to the start of the rampup of temperature, i.e. baseline of 32 and starts to rise for intended temperature
- TTL2 refers to the start of the plateau epoch, i.e. onset of intended temperature.

* Chapter \@ref(ch51_fir_glasserTPJttl2) plots the time series of pain stimulus onset, using TTL2 as reference

* Chapter \@ref(fmritimeseries_tt1) plots the time series of pain stimulus onset, using TTL1 as reference
