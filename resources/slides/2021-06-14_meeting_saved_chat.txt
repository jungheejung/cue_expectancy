16:14:03 From Tor Wager to Everyone : Nice graphics and presentation flow!

16:17:21 From Rotem Botvinik-Nezer to Everyone : Is it possible that difficulty in the cognitive task is harder the further you are from 0 / 180 degrees, or something like that? And then the “medium” one is actually more difficult than the “high” one? Not sure if it makes sense

16:17:40 From Tor Wager to Everyone : Side note: I wonder if there is an effort-accuracy tradeoff in the Cog task, where they more often give up in the most difficult condition?  This may not pan out but worth looking!

16:19:06 From Jack Ransom Lovell to Everyone : What about a generative account of cue integration?

16:19:13 From Michael Sun to Everyone : A minor point on the use of the term "actual experience", a strict empiricist reviewer would criticize that you're examining reported experience and not "actual experience" you could make your presentation stronger by defending the use of "actual experience" if you can say your design defends against memory biases, demand biases, etc.

16:19:37 From Jack Ransom Lovell to Everyone : p(s|c1, c2) is proportional to p(c1|s)p(c2|s)p(s) where s is the stimulus and c are the cues

16:20:48 From Michael Sun to Everyone : why does short trial length prevent you looking at single trial estimates? Didn't Bogdan look at 1s trials?

16:21:37 From Carmen Bango to Everyone : ^^ Re: effort-accuracy tradeoff: This really makes sense to me intuitively as a participant. I often just “gave up” and said the shapes were the same in the mental rotation task because I always felt that saying they were the same was safer than saying the shapes were different… I could not perceive different levels to the task, as it was always super difficult for me haha

16:23:25 From Tor Wager to Everyone : The “multiply PM maps for a and b” strategy in SPM doesn’t do the mediation quite right because brain is the outcome in the Path b equation, and cue is a covariate. But:  It just occurred to me that we could implement the mediation as it should be, but not in SPM. In our tools there is a “brain is Y” option in fmri_data.regress( ) that could be used to do the Path b equation analysis (well, both equations, really).

16:23:55 From Ke Bo to Everyone : There is way to solve the colinear problem in fast design(Say 1s): Mumford, J. A., Turner, B. O., Ashby, F. G., & Poldrack, R. A. (2012). Deconvolving BOLD activation in event-related designs for multivoxel pattern classification analyses. Neuroimage, 59(3), 2636-2643.

16:25:51 From Tor Wager to Everyone : Yes, that’s a good reference Ke…we were thinking that it would still be impractical to estimate single trial models in this design. But it may be possible.  FYI, all, Gang Chen at NIH has been doing more work in this area and has an even better model, it seems, implemented in AFNI. Related to Empirical Bayes regularization I think.

16:29:26 From Tor Wager to Everyone : canlab_variance_decomposition.m

16:34:48 From Michael Sun to Everyone : One hypothesis framing option is evolutionary: arguing for domain specificity for brain organization related to self-preservation/survival (pain and vicarious vs. cognitive)

16:39:58 From Tor Wager to Everyone : A side note: Theories of “predictive coding” and “active inference” are supposed to explain predictions, but do they? They don’t specify what kinds of predictions there are, how they relate to one another and to consciousness, and more.

16:42:17 From Jack Ransom Lovell to Everyone : I thought that was one of the points of predictive coding. It is not constrained to a particular task or system but rather generalizes across systems and tasks in the form of a simple PE.

16:45:23 From Luke Slipski to Everyone : Spoiler: I don’t think it all comes down to Hyperalignment

16:47:47 From Rotem Botvinik-Nezer to Everyone : Lol :)

16:48:21 From Heejung Jung to Everyone : Thanks everybody for the great comments. I’ll go over them one by one and address them next time (or in person!)

16:48:35 From Rotem Botvinik-Nezer to Everyone : Thanks for the great presentation, Heeding!

16:48:47 From Rotem Botvinik-Nezer to Everyone : Heejung (auto correct… weird)

16:50:04 From Carmen Bango to Everyone : ^^ Agree with Jack, I’ve always considered PC as a broad theory of how we are predictive organisms, actively making inferences about the world because that is more efficient than passively receiving information. But maybe research on predictive coding in specific domains will start to defy this idea?
